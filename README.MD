# Credit Card Default Prediction

## Overview

The Credit Card Default Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that can identify the likelihood of credit card holders defaulting on their payments. By leveraging historical data and various machine learning techniques, the project seeks to assist financial institutions in mitigating risk and making informed decisions regarding credit issuance. This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation to achieve an optimal predictive model.

## Approach

The approach followed in this notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Introduction**: Define the problem statement and objectives of the project.

2. **Data Description**: 
   - Provide a detailed description of the dataset, including the features and target variable.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize or standardize numerical features.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize the distribution of features.
   - Identify correlations between features.
   - Analyze patterns and trends in the data.

5. **Feature Selection**:
   - Select important features based on statistical methods and domain knowledge.

6. **Model Building**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

7. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Compare the performance of different models.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - Summarize findings, discuss model performance, and suggest potential next steps for further improvement.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following:

- Python 3.9 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to the credit card holders' demographics and payment history. Ensure to load the dataset in the notebook before running the cells.

## Results

The notebook provides insights into which features are most indicative of a default and compares the performance of different models. The final model can be used to predict the likelihood of a credit card default based on new customer data.
